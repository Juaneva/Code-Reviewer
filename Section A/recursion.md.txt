If you have a look at line 26 you will see that reverseString
is in camel-case. You should keep the name the same so 
the program will know what to return. 

In line 30 you have maxNumber, but you have already used
maxNumber, so perhaps you can change this to a fitting 
name for your int or you can change it in your function. 

You have left alot of white space in between your code. 
You can use less spaces to make your code cleaner.

Well done for your fantastic use of comments. Maybe you can
try using multi-line comments for those longer ones.
The layout of your program after it is run is also beautiful.
Great use of the line breaks!

Overall, great submission. Just fix the above and I'll have
another look.
